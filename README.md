## Restaurant Booking System

A lightweight Java-based REST API with a simple HTML+JS frontend to manage restaurant table bookings. Built using **mu-server**, this Maven project simulates a real-world restaurant system with both customer and owner flows.

### üìù Assumptions

To simplify the scope and focus on demonstrating core functionality, the following assumptions have been made:

- **No persistent storage**  
  All data (e.g., bookings, sessions) is stored **in memory** and lost when the server restarts.

- **Single owner user**  
  There is **only one hardcoded owner account**:  
  - Username: `admin`  
  - Password: `password123`

- **No user registration/authentication for customers**  
  Customers do **not need to log in**; they simply submit their booking form.

- **Date and time validation is minimal**  
  Assumes:
  - The customer inputs a valid future date
  - The selected time is from the predefined list

- **No concurrency handling**  
  Since this is a demo, it doesn‚Äôt handle concurrent access or race conditions (e.g., double-booking a table).

- **Frontend is served as static resources**  
  All HTML pages (`index.html`, `booking-form.html`, etc.) are located in the `resources/static/` directory and are served directly via the embedded server.

- **Basic cookie-based session**  
  Login sets a session cookie; no advanced JWT or OAuth used.

- **No CSS frameworks or build tools**  
  Styling is done using basic inline CSS without libraries like Bootstrap or Tailwind.
